I am Dustin Chilson, I'm a technology enthusiest and I love learning new technologies,
patterns, and techniques. I work as a Senior Software Developer for SalesPad building
cloud based ERP systems. In my current role I oversee the infrastructure and deployment
for a large scale ERP system based on the .Net stack and hosted on Microsoft Azure.

This site is meant to be my home page, a place for ramblings, triumphs and lessons learned.

My current tools of choice are C#, Asp.Net WebApi, and AngularJs. I've worked extensively with Window, Linux, and Microsoft Azure.
